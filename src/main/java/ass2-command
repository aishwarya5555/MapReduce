Q21 
 1. Create 10 files, each with different names and data such as file1.txtâ€¦file10.txt in local file system
       mkdir input
       vi file1.text
       vi file2.text
       ...
       vi file10.text
 
2. Copy these 10 files from local file system to source folder of HDFS
    hdfs dfs -copyFromLocal /mnt/home/edureka_1142691/input/* source

3. Copy the files present in source folder to target folder of HDFS
	hdfs dfs -cp source/* target

4. Change file2.txt and file4.txt in local folder by adding some new rows and copy these files to source folder of HDFS
	vi file2.text or echo "hello world" > file1.txt
	vi file4.text
	
5. Write a Java utility which reads the checksum of each file in source folder, compares with each file on target folder and decided whether to copy or not.
   CopyModifiedFiles.java
6. Run the utility on source and target folders. It should copy only file2.txt and file4.txt

Q23
===============================================================================================================================
List filename along with its size recursively for the files present in the HDFS folder.
Find the list of all HDFS files which does not contain any data i.e size=0 and print them in the output
Delete all the files obtained in the above step from HDFS
1. create files as below
   vi file11.text (add some content)
   vi file12.text (no content)
2. copy files from local to HDFS (delete_empty_Dir)  
   hdfs dfs -copyFromLocal  /mnt/home/edureka_1142691/input/* /user/edureka_1142691/delete_empty_Dir
3. List files 
   hdfs dfs -ls deleteEmptyDir/*
